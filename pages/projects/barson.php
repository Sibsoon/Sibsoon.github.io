<p>This is the <b>Ludum Dare 50</b> submission from our team. The theme was <b>Delay the inevitable</b>. Our take on this is a late night conversation with a stranger who wants to burn down the bar.
You can prolong this fate by creating fascinating stories by playing cards with the stranger. Everything was made from scratch and during the jam. Have fun trying the game!</p>
