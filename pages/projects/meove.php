<b>MEOVE</b> is our project submission for the 
<a href="https://gtc.inf.ethz.ch/education/game-programming-laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Programming Laboratory</a> 
of ETH ZÃ¼rich. It is an adventure puzzle game with the theme "Puss in Boots" by the Grim Brothers. The game was done from scratch with the minimalistic 
game engine <a href="https://www.monogame.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monogame</a>. We worked in a team of five students over a time span of three months.
We created everything from scratch. This includes the artistic parts like 3D modelling, 2D artwork, game music and soundtrack, shaders and UI. All the code was developped from 
scratch as well. The technical challenge for the course is the successful implementation of realtime skinned animations. A detailed report can be found <a href="https://gtc.inf.ethz.ch/education/game-programming-laboratory/previous-years/2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>.
Unfortunately there is no playable version publicly available.
